<h1>MISSION BRIEF</h1>
		
<form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank">

<h3>SITUATION</h3>
<p>Good morning, <input type="text" name="0" value="sector of work"> Agent NDF_<input type="text" name="#" value="number">. Your mission, should you chose to accept it, will be to 
  <input type="text" name="1" value="action-verb"> the socially advanced terrain of the Redwater Sheepsundo — what we’ve come to acknowledge as the most destructive influence against fence-sitters who collectively may have the impact to reverse the insidious <input type="text" name="2" value="noun-future trend or topic"> movement that’s spreading. </p>
		
<h3>MISSION  / EXECUTION </h3>
<p>We have the PETmarkers and MEGs of the most affected, cadmium <input type="text" name="3" value="noun-body of people">, but it’s difficult to quantify how deep they run. We’ve got stats on quantified spread, but depth is critical for fence-sitters. General Vonwatts has divulged the lateral left portion of the social brain of this insidious redgroup to us with promise of confidentiality — as I mentioned, we have both PET markers and phase-2 static MEG readers captured. Each of you will receive 900kr on your encrypted system drive. For each krux correlation you’ll need to process with extreme care and assure no personal social keys are leaked through the SQUID. You may leverage your own personal keys, however. Encrypt for spread with your tonally-<input type="text" name="3" value="your leadership style"> caution. Install Sundo’s THERESA onto your system drives for the phase-2 decryption keys. It’s important to uninstall your advertblinders on both your overlay and your primary <input type="text" name="4" value="futures exercise tool">. We realize it’s difficult, but to carry out your <input type="text" name="5" value="your purpose">execution, it’s these <input type="text" name="6" value="your orientation"> patterns that have permitted the redwater to largely integrate into the central temporal so-Comp — the most influential to active behavior. Use these to your knowledge. Be aware of the backcode. </p>
<h3>RISKS / CONCERNS</h3>
<p>We have limited details how to dislodge the temporal interface soaked by the mass redwater collective. We urge you to be aware of the glamour of ease. It’s ease that permits coasting. The Sheepsundo takes hold of our perception before it evolves to our roots. When perception and social materiality are masked, your roots are most vulnerable to Redwater — especially with your adblinders uninstalled. </p>
<p>This is your call to action. Be wary. You’ve spent the duration of training nailing your ability to <input type="text" name="7" value="intended use">. Remember your tools are not always formal. Your internal (purpose) is registered with your system drive, and we’ll be locking into your baseline, mapping your system network, personal key, and encrypting your self-positioned <input type="text" name="7" value="positioning role">tonal recognition for on your pseudo host. When you initiated training, the scanners MEG readers installed through Sundo’s THERESA registered that a number of you are more susceptible to redwater than others. I cannot emphasize enough to leverage your <input type="text" name="8" value="internal network category">. <br>

<h3>COMMUNICATIONS<br>
</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>SERVICE SUPPORT</h3>
<p>You ask advice? What a very human and very dangerous thing to do… For to give advice to an <input type="text" name="9" value="your positioning"> agent implies something very close to egomania. Your target are the fence-sitters but to presume to point you towards the most <input type="text" name="10" value="your framework">)… ha! That is your job alone. To point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself. Such leads us towards the susteciple nature of SUNDO in the first place. It’s only your own driving <input type="text" name="11" value="purpose">. <br>
